Analysis of mean monthly earnings in European countries with results presented in a map. 

The statistics used in this program are taken from the Eurostat database and Statistics of Estonia database. 

The following results are presented:
- descriptive statistics for mean monthly earnings in European countries
- European map where mean monthly earnings of European countries are presented in terms of Estonian deciles

Overall, this is my first attempt to make some data analysis in R programming language.
